Hello! I'm João Maia, an MSc student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisbon. I'm currently working on my thesis and conducting research at INESC-ID, with a focus on spatial accelerators and data-streaming applications.

For the past three years, I've worked part-time as a Systems Administrator, and did some work HPC work!
