Hello! I'm João Maia, an MSc student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisbon. I'm currently working on my thesis and conducting research at [INESC-ID](https://www.inesc-id.pt/member/26650/), with a focus on spatial accelerators and data-streaming applications.

For the past three years, I've worked part-time as a Systems Administrator and did some HPC work.

I'm doing my thesis on "Data-streaming support on Gemmini tensor architecture" advised by [Prof. Nuno Roma](http://hpcas.inesc-id.pt/~nfvr) and [Prof. Pedro Tomás](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedrotomas).
